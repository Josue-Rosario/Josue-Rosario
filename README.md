# Hi:wave: everyone ...

## My name is Josue Rosario. I am a web developer trying to grow a career in the world of Tech. Happy to have uniques experiences on each website and apps that I'm building on. In my free time I enjoy to play Call of duty, amplify my knowledge doing research in search engines, youtube, etc. And the last one no less important, have quality time with my family(üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß).
